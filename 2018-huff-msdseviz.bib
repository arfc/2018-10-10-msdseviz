	abstract = {The French 2012-2015 Commission Nationale d{\textquoteright}Evaluation Reports emphasize preparation for a transition from Light Water Reactors (LWRs) to Sodium- Cooled Fast Reactors (SFRs). We used the Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator to explore the feasibility of enabling a French transition to an SFR fleet by using Used Nuclear Fuel (UNF) from other European Union (EU) nations. A Cyclus simulation captured nuclear power deployment in the EU from 1970 to 2160. In this simulation, France begins its planned transition to SFRs as existing LWRs are decommissioned. These SFRs are fuelled with UNF accumulated by other EU nations and reprocessed in France. The impact of reactor lifetime extensions and SFR breeding ratios on time-to-transition were investigated with additional simulations. These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid deployment of additional LWRs by accepting UNF from other EU nations, that lifetime extensions delay time-to-transition, and improved breeding ratios are not particularly impactful.},

	title = {Standardized {Verification} of the {Cyclus} {Fuel} {Cycle} {Simulator}},
	abstract = {Many nuclear fuel cycle simulators can analyze transitions from once-through to advanced nuclear fuel cycles. Verification studies compare various fuel cycle analysis tools to test agreement and identify sources of difference. A recent verification study, B. Feng et al., {\textquotedblleft}Standardized verification of fuel cycle modeling,{\textquotedblright} Annals of Nuclear Energy, vol. 94, pp. 300-312, Aug. 2016 [1] established transition scenario test case specifications and accordingly evaluated national laboratory nuclear fuel cycle simulators, DYMOND VISION, ORION, and MARKAL. This work verifies the performance of Cyclus, the agent-based, open-source fuel cycle simulator, using the test case specifications in Feng et. al.
In this work, Cyclus demonstrates agreement with the results from the previous verification study. Minor differences reflect intentional, detailed material tracking in the Cycamore reactor module. These results extend the example results in Feng et. al to further enable future verification of additional nuclear fuel cycle simulation tools.},

	title = {Modeling and {Simulation} of {Online} {Reprocessing} in the {Molten} {Salt} {Breeder} {Reactor}},
	abstract = {Today, climate change drives humanity{\textquoteright}s search for new ways to generate carbon-free, reliable base-load power. Thus, interest in advanced nuclear energy and particularly Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) has resurged, with multiple new companies pursuing commercialization of MSR designs (e.g. Transatomic, Terrapower, Terrestrial, Moltex Energy, Thorcon). To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2, to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a full-core, high-fidelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and verifies these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-fidelity analyses.},

	abstract = {Cyclus, a nuclear fuel cycle simulator, was used to simulate the United States{\textquoteright} nuclear fuel cycle from 1967 through 2013. The spent nuclear spent nuclear fuel (SNF) inventory from the Cyclus simulation was compared to the SNF inventory from the Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation \& Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNFST\&DARDS) Unified Database (UDB). The UDB provides comprehensive and consistent technical data on reactor sites and SNF from the beginning of nuclear reactor operation in the United States (US) until 2013. This comparison between Cyclus and UDB establishes a realistic validation of Cyclus{\textquoteright} capability to produce total spent fuel mass and accurate isotopic compositions that closely match reality.},
